# EightQueens
Backtracking algorithm for solving eight queens

## What it is
A backtracking algorithm for solving the eight queens puzzles, where you have to place N queens on an NxN board (in this case, N = 8). 

## Why it is
I decided to do this in order to give myself a little more experience with backtracking before tackling the sudoku solver I started earlier.
